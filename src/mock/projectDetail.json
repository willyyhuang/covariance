  "description": "FreePrint takes the form of a free desktop 3D printer capable of printing plastic objects. Since many parts of FreePrint are made from plastic and FreePrint prints those parts, FreePrint self-replicates by making a kit of itself - a kit that anyone can assemble given time and materials. It also means that - if you've got a FreePrint - you can print lots of useful stuff, and you can print another FreePrint for a friend!",
